In this project, we introduced an embedded system for real-time atrial diagnosis based on a multimodal analysis of ECG data. The system combines the latest machine learning techniques, IoT devices, and interfaces to provide a complete solution to continuous heart monitoring. HeartPal is designed to overcome the drawbacks of conventional ECG systems and become an effective, portable, and accurate tool for the early diagnosis and control of Atrial fibrillation (AF), which will help enhance patients' quality of life and decrease the costs of health care services.
