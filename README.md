# Objective
### Cardiovascular disorders remain the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17% of all deaths. The World Health Organization estimates there are 9 million deaths ascribed to these conditions each year. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that significantly increases the risk of stroke and heart failure. Hence, proper management of AF entails early identification of the condition and constant supervision to prevent serious consequences. However, existing ECG monitoring systems are expensive, complicated, and require hospital visits, making them inadequate for continuous real-time monitoring, especially in non-clinical settings. The IoT technology has rapidly accelerated a drastic change in the healthcare sector by establishing portable health monitoring systems. These IoT-based systems enable constant surveillance of the patientâ€™s condition, timely notification, and significantly better outcomes. Despite their potential, current IoT-based ECG monitoring solutions often fail to provide a full range of multimodal diagnostic tools designed to identify Atrial fibrillation (AF). In this project, we introduced an embedded system for real-time atrial diagnosis based on a multimodal analysis of ECG data. The system combines the latest machine learning techniques, IoT devices, and interfaces to provide a complete solution to continuous heart monitoring. HeartPal is designed to overcome the drawbacks of conventional ECG systems and become an effective, portable, and accurate tool for the early diagnosis and control of Atrial fibrillation (AF), which will help enhance patients' quality of life and decrease the costs of health care services.
